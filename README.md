RAPSCALLION is a small text-based adventure RPG inspired by games like Caves of Qud, Pathfinder, Baldur's Gate,
Divinity: Original Sin, and Dungeons and Dragons. It is intended as an exploration of a multitude of themes relevant
to the real world we exist in, including but not limited to: gender, sexuality, morality, community, love, and unity.
It is set in a world of my own devision, albeit one that heavily borrows from existing media and cultures.
It is created, written, coded, and maintained by me, LemonJamTart, for fun and in my free time. It will probably maybe
never be available for purchase (although who is to say what the future holds). However, donations are of course appreciated, and I will be setting up some avenues for such things ASAP.
if you like what I do and want to support me. New builds will be pushed to this Github as they are made. 
Much love,
Lemon.
